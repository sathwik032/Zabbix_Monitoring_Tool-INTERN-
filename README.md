This internship report presents a comprehensive study on the implementation and usage of the Zabbix Monitoring Tool, carried out at ITC Limited – Paperboards & Specialty Papers Division (PSPD), Bhadrachalam, under the Information Systems Department. The internship provided practical exposure to real-time IT infrastructure monitoring and system administration practices in an industrial environment.Zabbix is an open-source enterprise-level monitoring solution used for tracking the performance, availability, and health of servers, networks, virtual machines, databases, and applications. During the internship period, hands-on experience was gained in installing, configuring, and managing Zabbix components such as the Zabbix Server, Agents, Web Interface, Database, and Proxies. The project also involved deploying Zabbix on a Linux environment, running Ubuntu on Hyper-V, and integrating MySQL for backend database management.The study covers key Zabbix features including real-time monitoring, alerting mechanisms, triggers, dashboards, templates, and ICMP-based network monitoring. Special emphasis was placed on performance tuning, particularly optimizing MySQL and Zabbix server parameters to handle write-intensive workloads efficiently. Monitoring of system performance metrics, host availability, and network latency was successfully demonstrated.This internship enhanced understanding of enterprise monitoring systems, virtualization technologies, Linux administration, and database optimization. Overall, the project highlights how Zabbix helps organizations proactively detect issues, improve system reliability, and maintain efficient IT operations, making it a powerful tool for modern infrastructure monitoring.
